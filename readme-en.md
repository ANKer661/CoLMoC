# Protein Clustering Analysis Based on Contrastive Learning  

This is my ***graduation project***. The main files in this project are:

1. `preprocess.ipynb`: Used for data preprocessing to convert the data into the format we need.

2. `modeling_grad.py`: Includes dataset structure, graph neural network structure, SwAV contrastive learning implementation, and provides a `train_model` function for convenient parameter settings during training.

3. `run.py`: Build dataset, train model and save model parameters.

## `preprocess.ipynb`
Required Python packages: `torch`, `tokenizers`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`

This file is mainly used for data preprocessing to convert the data into the format we need (including atom information, amino acid information and connectivity information) for building our dataset in subsequent files.

Required files: Cartesian coordinates of required atoms in npy format (can be extracted from traj files)

Parts that need modification:

1. Line 1 in the second code block `np.load('xxx.npy')` should be changed to the filename that stores all the Cartesian coordinates of atoms.

2. Line 2 in the second code block `atom_type` should be changed to the types of each atom in the molecule to study. 

3. Line 3 in the second code block `aa_type` should be changed to the amino acid type that each atom in the molecule to study belongs to.

4. Line 4 in the second code block `connections` is a list where each element represents which atoms the atom is connected to. It can be obtained in VMD using the command `[atomselect top all] getbonds`.

5. The rest of the contents do not need to be modified, just run through.

Output files:

1. `edge_index.pt`: Connectivity information 

2. `aa_inputs.pt`: Tokenized amino acid type inputs

3. `atom_inputs.pt`: Tokenized atom type inputs

4. `pt_coords.pt`: Required atoms' Cartesian coordinates

## `modeling_grad.py`
Required Python packages: `torch_geometric`, `torch`, `numpy`

This file includes dataset structure, graph neural network structure, SwAV contrastive learning implementation, and provides a `train_model` function for convenient parameter settings during training. 

If you just want to run the code, you don't need to delve into the specific code implementation in this file. The parts related to parameter settings will be introduced in `run.py`.

### Graph Neural Network Structure

![Node Initialization Module](figs/node_init.png "Node Initialization Module")

As shown above, the initialization module maps the Cartesian coordinates, atom information and amino acid information to node_dim dimensional vectors for initializing N (node features) in GNN. N will be further used to initialize E (edge features) with dimension edge_dim in GNN. E initializes u (global features) with dimension global_dim. Specific steps can be found in lines 116 and 154 in `modeling_grad.py`. These dimensions can all be conveniently set as described in the next section `run.py`.

Projector is an experimentally proven effective trick. Its role is to map u to a higher dimension proj_hidden_dim, then gradually compress it to a lower dimension proj_output_dim, e.g. 64 → 128 → 32 → 8. The specific structure of Projector can be found in line 478 in `modeling_grad.py`.

![Overall Architecture](figs/encoder_arch.png "Overall Architecture")

The above figure shows a schematic diagram of the overall graph neural network architecture. The small black dots indicate aggregation and update of information, the dotted lines indicate the source of information, from left to right representing the order of aggregation and update, i.e. E→N→u. What happens in each update step can be found starting from lines 246, 289, 341 in `modeling_grad.py`.

### SwAV Method
Please refer to the original paper [SwAV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882v5 "https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09882v5")

## `run.py`

This file is mainly used to train the model with all parameters set here. 

```python
# Line 20 PATH may need to be changed to the path storing the corresponding data
PATH = r"./data"  
atom_inputs = torch.load(f"{PATH}/atom_inputs.pt")
aa_inputs = torch.load(f"{PATH}/aa_inputs.pt")
edge_index = torch.load(f"{PATH}/edge_index.pt")
cartesian_coord = torch.load(f"{PATH}/coords.pt")
cartesian_coord = (cartesian_coord  
                   - cartesian_coord.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True) / cartesian_coord.shape[1]) # Center
```

```python 
# Line 44, set model architecture
model = SwavMoleculeTrain(
    num_atom=num_atoms,  # Automatically set based on data 
    num_aa=num_aa, # Automatically set based on data
    coord_inputs_dim=3, # Fixed to 3
    node_dim=64, # Node attribute dimension in GNN, see "Graph Neural Network Structure" for details
    edge_attr_dim=64, # Edge attribute dimension in GNN 
    global_attr_dim=64, # Global attribute dimension in GNN
    dropout_prob=0.0, # Suggest 0

    proj_hidden_dim=256, # Dimension of the first fully connected layer in projector, see line 478 in modeling_grad.py for projector structure
    proj_output_dim=proj_output_dim, # Final output dimension of projector
    norm_type="graphnorm", # Suggest "graphnorm", other options are batchnorm and layernorm
)
```

```python
# Line 64, set some hyperparameters
batch_size = 512 # Set based on GPU memory 
num_epochs = 100 # Can modify
temperature = 0.25 # Can try 0.05 to 0.25
lr = 4.8e-2 # Can modify
```

```python  
# Lines 93-101, optimizer and scheduler settings, usually do not need modification
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1, momentum=0.9, weight_decay=1e-6) # weight_decay can modify
scheduler = get_cos_lr_scheduler(
    optimizer, warmup_steps=0.1 * num_epochs * len(train_loader),
    total_steps=num_epochs * len(train_loader), 
    warmup_init_lr=0.1 * lr,
    max_lr=lr,
    min_lr=1e-3 * lr # Can modify

optimizer = LARC(optimizer=optimizer, trust_coefficient=0.001, clip=False)
```

```python

            f'_d{proj_output_dim}_{temperature}' 
            f'_eps0.05_LARS_{lr}') 
```

```python

# See line 734 in modeling_grad.py for details of the training loop

## How to Load Trained Model Parameters
Can refer to `visualization.ipynb`, it is a program for visualization and plotting, is not written very formally, just for reference. It demonstrates how to load trained model parameters and obtain clustering results.

### Load Model Parameters
```python
num_atoms = dataset[0][0].unique().size(0) 
num_aa = dataset[0][1].unique().size(0)
num_prototypes = 4
# Note here we use SwavMolecule model, SwavMoleculeTrain was used during training
# Parameter settings need to match training, otherwise there will be errors
model = SwavMolecule(  
    num_atom=num_atoms,
    num_aa=num_aa,
    coord_inputs_dim=3,
    node_dim=64,
    edge_attr_dim=64, 
    global_attr_dim=64,
    dropout_prob=0.0,
    num_layers=12,
    num_prototypes=num_prototypes,
    use_projector=True,
    proj_hidden_dim=128,
    proj_output_dim=8,
    norm_type="graphnorm",
)

ROOT = "./" # May need to change to path storing checkpoints
ckpt_path = ROOT + "swav_mole.pth" 
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(ckpt_path)['model']) # Loading complete
```

### Get Clustering Results and Features
```python
cluster_all = torch.empty((0))  
u_all = torch.empty((0, 8)) # Shape should match proj_output_dim

for batch in tqdm(dataloader, total=len(dataloader)):
    model.eval()
    atom_id, amino_acids_id, data_batch = batch
    batch_size = atom_id.size(0)
    edge_index = data_batch.edge_index
    x = data_batch.x
    with torch.no_grad():
        res = model(
            x.to(device),
            atom_id.to(device),
            amino_acids_id.to(device),
            edge_index.to(device) 
        )
        # See lines 634+ in modeling_grad.py
        # Can also modify code for model to output additional features like encoder output
        
        scores = res['scores'].cpu()
        u = res['features'].cpu()

        z = u / u.norm(dim=1, keepdim=True, p=2)
        p = torch.nn.functional.softmax(scores / temperature, dim=-1)
        
        # Get clustering results  
        cluster = torch.argmax(p, dim=1)
        cluster_all = torch.concat((cluster_all, cluster), dim=0)

        u_all = torch.concat((u_all, u), dim=0)
```
